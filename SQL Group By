#*****Need to select column for group by and column for calculation

#Group by + aggregate by average value
SELECT gender, AVG(height)
FROM patients
Group BY gender;

#Group by + aggregate by sum value
SELECT gender, SUM(height)
FROM patients
Group BY gender;

#Group by + aggregate by count value
SELECT gender, COUNT(height)
FROM patients
Group BY gender;

#Aggregate more than 1 value
SELECT gender, SUM(height), AVG(weight)
FROM patients
Group BY gender;

#Combine group by with sorting
#Example 1
SELECT gender, SUM(height), AVG(weight)
FROM patients
Group BY gender
ORDER BY gender DESC;

#Example 2
SELECT gender, SUM(height), AVG(weight)
FROM patients
Group BY gender
ORDER BY AVG(weight);

#Combine group by with WHERE condition
SELECT gender, SUM(height), AVG(weight)
FROM patients
WHERE gender = 'M'
Group BY gender;

#Combine GROUP BY with WHERE with ORDER BY
SELECT city, AVG(height) AS 'tall', AVG(weight) AS 'fat'
FROM patients
WHERE 'fat' > 60
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY 'fat' DESC; 

#Showing only top 5 values = LIMIT 5
SELECT city, AVG(height) AS 'tall', AVG(weight) AS 'fat'
FROM patients
WHERE 'fat' > 60
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY 'fat' DESC
LIMIT 5; 

#Combine group by with join from other tables
