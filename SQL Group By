#*****Need to select column for group by and column for calculation

#Group by + aggregate by average value
SELECT gender, AVG(height)
from patients
Group BY gender;

#Group by + aggregate by sum value
SELECT gender, SUM(height)
from patients
Group BY gender;

#Group by + aggregate by count value
SELECT gender, COUNT(height)
from patients
Group BY gender;

#Aggregate more than 1 value
SELECT gender, SUM(height), AVG(weight)
from patients
Group BY gender;

#Combine group by with sorting
#Example 1
SELECT gender, SUM(height), AVG(weight)
from patients
Group BY gender
ORDER BY gender DESC;

#Example 2
SELECT gender, SUM(height), AVG(weight)
from patients
Group BY gender
ORDER BY AVG(weight);

#Combine group by with join from other tables
