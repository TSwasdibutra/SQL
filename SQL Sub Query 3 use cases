Sub query can be used in 3 ways

1. sub query within WHERE

2. sub query within SELECT = เอาไว้ใช้เช่นกรณีอยาก compare ค่า average value ของทั้ง dataset กับค่า groupby
SELECT city, height, 
(SELECT AVG(height)
 FROM patients) AS average_height
 FROM patients;

3. sub query within FROM = like creating a sub table (ex. pivot table) that you can pull column from
use case = find the total sum or total average value of the value from pivot table

****CTE can do the same as this and it is better
SELECT SUM(max_height) 
FROM (SELECT city, MAX(height) AS max_height
     FROM patients
     GROUP BY city);
